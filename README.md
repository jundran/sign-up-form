## Description
TOP - Sign-up Form project

An accessible and responsive sign up form demonstrating both HTML and client-side JavaScript validation.

## Experimental
CSS styles highlight invalid input fields. The <em><b>:user-invalid</b></em> pseudo-class selector is used to only target invalid input fields that have been modified and then clicked or tabbed away from. This is only supported on Firefox.

Other browsers use the <em><b>:invalid</b></em> pseudo-class selector, but this selects all required input fields on load as they are empty. Invalid styling is applied before the user has had chance to start filling out the form.
